# TODO

- Manage subscriptions: monthly, yearly, custom maybe.
- Auto renew of the plan.
- Automatically cancel the service if he didn’t pay.
- Implement the billing info in the Billings table. I notice you never have explained unions on typeorm I think(maybe I’m wrong) so this way we could check them out for the ones starting on Postgres.
