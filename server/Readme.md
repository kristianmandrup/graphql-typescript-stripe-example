# Server

## Start server

Ensure you have Postgres DB installed and running as a daemon process.

See these videos:

- [Docker PostgreSQL Tutorial with Persistent Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3gnMSyX-XM)
- [Docker Compose Tutorial with PostgreSQL and Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9bA5HpOk30)

## Getting started

### Mac OSX

Install postgres by following [this guide](https://www.codementor.io/engineerapart/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-mac-osx-are8jcopb)

Star the server as follows:

`$ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start`

## Getting stated: Docker image

Install and run the standard `postgres` docker image

`$ npm run postgres`

Then add a `postgres` role

`CREATE ROLE postgres;`

See [Donâ€™t install Postgres. Docker pull Postgres](https://hackernoon.com/dont-install-postgres-docker-pull-postgres-bee20e200198)

### Create a Directory to Serve as the Local Host Mount Point for Postgres Data Files

`mkdir -p $HOME/docker/volumes/postgres`

### Run the Postgres Container

```bash
docker run --rm   --name pg-docker -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -d -p 5432:5432 -v $HOME/docker/volumes/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data  postgre
```

### Connect to Postgres

`psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres`

### Missing user/role

Create the user `postgres` with SUPERUSER access, if missing

`CREATE USER postgres WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'postgres';`

```bash
$ psql postgres
psql (10.5)
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# CREATE USER postgres WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'postgres';
postgres=# \q
```

## Docker build

Build docker image using `Dockerfile` and tag it as: `stripe-example-multi-stage`

The docker services (each with a `Dockerfile`) are in the `/services` folder

- `docker build -t stripe-example-multi-stage services/web`

The `web` service in `docker-compose.yml` is based on the `stripe-example-multi-stage`

```yml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres
    # ...
  web:
    image: stripe-example-multi-stage
    depends_on:
      - db
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
```

If the docker image `stripe-example-multi-stage` builds without error, you should be able to run:

- `docker-compose up`

Which will run the `db` image `postgres` AND the `web` image `stripe-example-multi-stage`

This will effectively be your server and you can now run the client that will connect to the server through Apollo Client.

The `web` image of the docker compose will run the NodeJS web (express) server and expose the GraphQL api on `localhost:4000`

## Web server (GraphqL and DB)

You can also run the web server directly as follows:

```bash
$ yarn start
yarn run v1.5.1
warning package.json: No license field
warning ../package.json: No license field
$ nodemon --exec ts-node src/index.ts
[nodemon] 1.18.4
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching: *.*
[nodemon] starting `ts-node src/index.ts`
ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

Server is ready for action!

### Troubleshooting

If TypeScript fails to build the dist on the image (via `tsc -b`), it could be well be an issue with uppercase vs lowercase letters in the filename. For file references in `import` statements, make sure they match the filename exactly!

## DB

### User entity

- `email` the user email (for login, ie. authentication)
- `password` the user password (for login, ie. authentication)
- `stripeId` the StripeID of the customer account for the User on Stripe
- `type` if user has paid or is on free trial
- `ccLast4` (last 4 digits on credit card)

## Resolvers

- `Credit card`
- `Subscription`
- `Session`

### Credit card

#### change

- `findPaidUser` DB
- `updateCustomer` stripe API
- `updateUser` DB

Change credit card only makes sense if user has already paid for a subscription and thus had already registered a credit card.

### Subscription

#### create

- `findUser` DB
- `stripeIdFromCustomer` stripe API
- `updateCustomer` stripe API
- `updateUser` DB

Creating a new subscribtion only makes sense if user has is on `free-trial` and has not yet paid for a subscription.

#### cancel

- `findUser` DB
- `retrieveStripeCustomer` stripe API
- `getCustomerSubscription` stripe API
- `deleteSubscription` stripe API
- `deleteCard` stripe API
- `setUserType` DB

Cancel subscription only makes sense if user has already paid for a subscription.

### Session

#### login

- `findOne` User matching on `email`
- compare password via `bcrypt`
- set session on request

#### logout

- destroy user session on server
- clear cookie on request
